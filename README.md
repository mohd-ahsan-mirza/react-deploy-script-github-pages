# react-deploy-script-github-pages

The bash script included creates and deploys an intial react app for you on github provided you have the correct versions of npm, node and react installed on your machine. I have included the versions I was using when I built this script. 

You will also need git running on your commandline

Note: Before running this script, initialize an empty repo on github

$1 = Repo name
$2 = Github username
$3 = Github password

Pass in the parameters as shown above.

After the app has been published, open your package manager and copy paste the url for the homepage of your app into your browser. You should see the boilerplate react provides

Hope this helps!!
